# Exercise: Refactoring

- Implement in Mob Programming

### Scenario: Implement a Fizz Buzz game
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to an indicated number

- For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
- For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

The numbers and words are printed in LCD format.
